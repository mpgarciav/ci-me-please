# :mortar_board: Your task
- Clone this repo
- Create a simple CI pipeline for this application on [Travis CI](https://docs.travis-ci.com/) with (at least) the following steps:
    - Checkout
    - Test
    - Build
    - Slack notification on success or failure
    - Deploy this app to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) on success (yay! Continuous Deployment!)
- Bonus points:
    - Add the [Travis status image](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/status-images/) to your Readme
    - Add Pull Requests flows to your CI
    - Build a container for your app in your CI flow
    - Deploy the container to Heroku

## Deliverable
Send us:
- Your repo URL
- Your Travis URL
- Your deployed app URL

# :shipit: Suggestions
- Read (at least) the [Travis CI Core concepts for Beginners](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/for-beginners/) and the [Travis CI tutorial](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/tutorial/). 
    - Ask yourself, if we didn't provide these links, would you have looked for them?
    - How should you approach a completely new tool?
    - Look for the Slack and Heroku integrations in the Travis docs, they are very simple to navigate and easy to follow
- Google *everything* you don't know (Gradle, Travis, and Heroku are probably new tools for you, do you understand their purpose?)
- Remember, you cannot automate something you haven't done it manually first (I mean, you could, but you would struggle more than is necessary)
- Send too many Slack notifications and people will start ignoring them (nobody wants to see your 20-something attempts at setting up Slack notifications, use a test channel or your private conversation)
